    "In this notebook we explore the interaction between lactoferrin and a β-lactoglobulin dimer using Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The two protein structures are kept rigid and coarse grained so that each amino acid is represented by a single bead of size $\\sigma_i$. These beads interact with a combined Lennard-Jones and Debye-Hückel potential to account for short-range repulsion and attraction, as well as electrostatic interactions in an aqueous electrolyte solution.\n",
    "The ionization state of each amino acid is _fluctuating_ according to its p$K_a$-value and solution pH; this is done using a _constant pH ensemble_.\n",
    "The MC system energy function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U = \\sum_i^{N-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} \\left \\{ 4\\epsilon_{ij} \\left [ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \\right )^{12}  - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \\right )^{6}\\right ]\n",
    "  + k_BT \\frac{\\lambda_Bz_iz_j}{r_{ij}} \\right \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "$\\lambda_B=7$ Å is the Bjerrum length,\n",
    "$z$ are residue charges,\n",
    "$r$ the inter-residue separation,\n",
    "$\\epsilon=0.05~k_BT$ the Lennard-Jones interaction strength.\n",
    "The final term will be explaned below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass centers of the two rotating proteins are fixed along the z-axis. For each mass center distance a simulation is performed where a virtual translation move is incorporated to get the force from with the potential of mean force is calculated. The proteins are allowed rotational MC moves and move attempts are also performed to (de-)protonate acidic and basic residues. The salt particles are allowed to both rotate and translate.\n",
    "During simulation, we sample the radial distribution function, $g(R)$, which is related to the angularly averaged _potential of mean force_, $w(R) = -k_BT \\ln g(R) + w_0$, where the reference state $w_0$ is chosen such that $w(R)\\rightarrow 0$ for large $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the smaller distances, where to two proteins are placed closer to each other, were no or very few accepted moves performed, which resulted in unusable values of the virtual translation force. In order to come around this problem, parallel tempering was added to the simulation. Thus, this notebook was only used for explicit ion simulations with a protein-protein mass center distance of above 70 Å. This value was choosen by observing where too few moves were accepted in a simulation to produce a result and then an additional 5 Å were added to make sure that the offest distance was big enough to not cause any problems. Therefore, this notebook was used for mass cemter distances of 70 Å and above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that depending on how you structure your files you might need to make mainor changes to the script, also you need to define your work directory and directory of your fanus installation. "
