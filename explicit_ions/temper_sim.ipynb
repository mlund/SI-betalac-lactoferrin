    "### Monte Carlo simulation for protein-protein interactions\n",
    "Explicit ion concentration is used in the simulation. One protein is placed in origin in the simulation box and the other is placed on a specific distance on the z-axis from origin. For each distance a simulation is performed where a virtual translation move is incorporated to get the force from with the potential of mean force is calculated. However, for the smaller distances, where to two proteins are placed closer to each other, were no or very few accepted moves performed, which resulted in unusable values of the virtual translation force. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to come around this problem, parallel tempering was added to the simulation. It was known that with implicit ions did the previous setup give satisfactory results also for small distances. The tempering boxes were thus built up on a decreasing lambda parameter affecting the kappa and the charge of the ions. In the box representing the full explicit ion case, the lambda is 0. When the kappa is multiplied with the constant it becomes zero and as the charges are multiplied with (1-lambda) they remain unchanged and the first box illustrated the exact explicit ion case. In the other end, the last box will illustrate the implicit ion case. Inbetween are boxes where the ions are less and less \"explicit\". With the switching inbetween boxes, that the parallel tempering allows, it is desired to be able to measure the potential of mean force also when the proteins are located closer to each other. \n",
